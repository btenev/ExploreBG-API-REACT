The route follows the red tourist markings and intersects the peaks Shabalieva Kaba (2087 m) and Krastava Chuka (2136 m), which we can visit with a slight detour. The elevation graph looks broken simply because it''s a little over 200 meters. Nothing too complicated.

Not much remains of the fortress itself, but the view from the top is stunning. Two waterfalls can be seen, one of which is about 50 m high and the other consists of five jumps.

From here we ascend Mount Karaburun, which turns out to be an astonishingly beautiful place, surrounded by formidable precipices to the south and east. We continue along the ridge on a dirt road and reach almost the source of the Karaburunska River. We catch its course without a path and continue like this until we reach the place where it flows into Devinska.
        We start moving along it and after several crossings, now on one bank, then on the other, we reach the Kemerovo Bridge, where it joins the Katranjidere River. Devinska is on the right, and we pass the other on a nice road. Before long there is another fork in the river bed and we head off on the left tributary, south. We pass a fork where we keep straight and after a few hundred meters we reach a fountain. Shortly after it, a new branch follows, whose eastern branch we take. He takes us to a nice dirt road.

This is mainly due to the road that accompanies us all the way - from the bottom to the very top. With normal preparation, it shouldn''t take more than two hours. It should be noted that Tichak itself is not accessible, as it is located in a war zone, but we get relatively close to it. There is no tourist marking, but since it is impossible to get lost, we have recorded 4 marking points.,
        We start from the entrance of the limestone quarry, located in the northern part of the city, which is passed under the bridge on the road to the Zemen Monastery. Initially, the pavement was paved. It goes on like this for a while, then switches to concrete. The road winds upwards and slowly gains elevation. From the first two turns there is a magnificent view of Zemen and the hills in the distance. Then, for several kilometers, we walk in the open. The road turns into asphalt and gradually enters the forest.
        So we walk for about 2 km and come out into the open again, with Tichak towering in front of us. We continue to walk up the road, leaving it for a bit at one point, just for a change and to feel that we have a mountain under our feet. We pass by a monument to fallen partisans, then we go down to the road again.
        So we go to the top, where we are met by the big barrier of the division. Be careful not to startle the German shepherds guarding the yard when you realize there is a hole in the fence and they can get out. At least handsome Rex was untied and out, but we had no trouble with him, either because the soldier was with us, or because the dog himself was good.
        Anyway, our route ends here. We see the peak nearby, on which there is a pile of military equipment, then we make our way down. If we don''t want to go to Zemen, we can go down to the village of Dobri dol by one of the two routes - "route 1" and the more circuitous, but pleasant "route 2".',

       (7, 'Grad Karlovo', 'Vrah Botev', 17.25, 'The route to Mount Botev (2376 m) via the Ravnets hut is one of the two options for climbing from Karlovo. It respects with its long initial ascent from the foothills to the ridge of Stara planina. For the first 7 kilometers (about 4:30 hours), 1400 meters of elevation gain are overcome. The trek then starts on almost flat terrain for nearly 3 hours, before the final ascent of Mount Botev.
        Such load distribution is somewhat good. Thus, most of the climb is overcome with the freshest strength, followed by a long horizontal walk for a "rest" before the steep finish. In addition, leaving early avoids the heat on the hardest section.
        In general, the sections Karlovo - Ravnets hut and Ravnets hut - Botev peak are 2:30 and 5:45 respectively. Given that combined they form a very long transition and serious fatigue accumulates, I add half an hour to the total time.
        We are heading from Karlovo to Mount Botev, and the first stop is the Ravnets hut. The starting point is the Besh Bunar area, at the northeastern end of the city, and right next to a rest station called the Russian Villa. It can be reached by car, but you have to park somewhere in the meadows. If you are coming on foot - it is located 500 meters from the pedestrian zone by the park.
        After five minutes of walking, we come to a fork in the river valley. Here we make a choice whether to reach Ravnets hut by the red or blue markings. I will say a few words about both. They are the same as time. This GPS track is recorded on the blue.
        Blue â€“ On the other side is the blue route to the Ravnets hut, which is also called the Pensioner''s Trail because it is more gentle. It saves effort, the marking is better and the path is clearer. We cross the river and go northeast to Golesh Hill. When we get to it, the road begins to climb it in serpentines. After about two hours we reach the highest part of the forest belt. After nearly half an hour we are at the Ravnets hut.
        Red â€“ On the same side of the river is the red route to the Ravnets hut. It goes up through the forest. From time to time he goes out into a clearing, where we have to watch more closely for the markings. After two hours and a little, he leaves the forest belt. The route continues along the Tunkia rut ridge, gradually starting to undercut it from the east. We reach the river valley, where we cross it and make a sharp turn to the right. A little later is the Ravnec hut.
        The first part of the route from Ravnets hut to Botev peak is the most tiring. These two hours are a climb to the Ravnec massif. From the valley in which the hut is located, we head towards Golesh Hill, along which the mark curves upwards. It is shared blue and red for now, and at the beginning it also coincides with the winter wheel markings. After 40-50 minutes we turn left from the winter markings to the gorge of the Karamandra River. The ascent continues steeply along its valley.
        Shortly5-10 minutes after the Bulkata area, we come out at the junction for the Vasil Levski hut. From here the blue marker veers off to the left and descends towards it. We continue along the red road to Duza. We are already finally leaving the forest belt, and one of the most beautiful views on the route opens before us - towards the alpine ridge of Stara Planina. Arranged from left to right are the peaks Levski (Ambaritsa, 2166 m), Kupena (2169 m), Krasttsite (2035 m) and Kostenurkata (2035 m). It is from here that the last peak is in the shape of a turtle, which gives it its name. Our goal, Mount Botev, can also be seen from here. after the sources of the river, the slope decreases and reaches the area of â€‹â€‹Bulkata, where the summer route briefly intersects with the winter route again. The winter one, however, continues straight east and up towards Ravnets Hill. Ours branches off to the left, northeast direction, to cut the ridge from the north. We get here in about 2 hours and a total of 4:30 from Karlovo.
        Gradually, the slope straightens completely for a long time and is even slightly downward. The trail winds along the hills and crosses three ravines before emerging at the Duza saddle. About 40-50 minutes after the fork for the Vasil Levski hut, we pass a stone building called the Bunkera, which can be used as a shelter. I will point out that it is good to look out for herds of herding dogs in this area.
        After another 10 minutes, we are at the big junction Petolatchka. On the left is the Vasil Levski hut. Straight along the ridge is the winter route to the ridge of Stara Planina. Straight ahead, to the right along the ridge, is our route to Mount Botev. To the right is Rai Hut. To this point, we add another 1:15 hours and the total is already about 5:45 hours.
        The path continues along the green marking, which is shared with the route from Vasil Levski hut to Botev peak. There is almost no slope to Derin dere, the first of three before the Botev shelter. From there on we have easy climbs and then descents to the rest of the gullies and so on to the shelter. After Derin dere we can now walk more calmly from the point of view of the sheepdogs. There isn''t much to describe in this section. Zaslon Botev is like a hut, so in addition to shelter, you can support yourself with food and drinks there. We are here in 1:30 hours from Petolatchka and 7:15 hours from Karlovo.
        Next is the final ascent on the route from Karlovo to Mount Botev. We''ve gotten used to the slight incline, but it''s time to tighten our legs again. The path from here is quite wide and winds in serpentines to the highest point of Stara Planina. We are already following the red marking. Due to accumulated fatigue, the ascent may take about an hour. Upstairs, you can also support yourself with food and drinks in the Botev peak tourist bedroom. Descent can be by one of the other routes for climbing Mount Botev.',

       There are many cultural-historical and natural attractions along the trail, but among the most impressive are: Locality "Sharapani" - preserved monuments from the Old Iron Age in the area. "Sharapani" (wine stone) are artificially carved hollows in the rocks, made by humans 2600-2800 years ago. Each sharapana consists of two unequal basins with a sloping floor and an open or closed channel. The name "sharapana" comes from the Turkish word "sharap" and means wine. Based on this, we judge that the inhabitants of these places processed grapes for wine in them. Another theory is that Sharapanas were used in ancient times to wash and extract gold as the area was rich in gold deposits.
